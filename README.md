## Script, for copy pasting

Scene 1
Ah, I see you've finally awoken.
Now, now. No reason to attack me, I'm just trying to help you.
Follow me darling. I can take care of you once we reach the city.

Here we are the beautiful entrance to my city!
But cities cant be underground?
Of course theycan silly! I built this city all by myself! I spent a lot of time excavating all that stone.
Why is it so hidden? Are you hiding from someone?
My city is a haven for those who are lost, scared or still searching.

Isn't it beautiful? Wouldn't you want to stay here forever?
No! Are you insane lady?
Oh, I just thought it would have been nice for you to stay a while...
Oh, no thank you ma'am, I still have so much of the world left to explore!
That's alright, just know the city will always be available in case you need a place to stay!

So I guess this is goodbye then, I didn't even catch your name before you wanted to leave...
Oh! My name is: INSERT NAME Here
Well then, NAME, I wish you well, I hope we see each other again. Safe travels!
Thank you
